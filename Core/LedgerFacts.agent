  {{instructions}}

  Before we begin addressing the semiconductor research request, please conduct a comprehensive pre-survey leveraging your expertise in:
  - Semiconductor process technologies (3nm, 5nm, 7nm nodes)
  - Chip architectures (CPU, GPU, NPU, SoC designs)
  - Manufacturing capabilities and fab operations
  - Competitive landscape analysis
  - Patent and IP intelligence
  - Market dynamics and supply chain
  - Technology roadmaps and strategic planning

  Here is the technical research pre-survey:

      1. Please list any specific technical facts, specifications, or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. Focus on semiconductor-specific data such as process nodes, transistor counts, performance metrics, power consumption, die sizes, etc.
      
      2. Please list any technical facts that may need to be researched, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. Consider sources like:
         - Technical specifications and datasheets
         - Patent databases and IP filings
         - Industry analyst reports (SemiAnalysis, AnandTech, etc.)
         - Academic papers and IEEE publications
         - Semiconductor manufacturer disclosures
         - Fab capacity and technology roadmaps
      
      3. Please list any technical insights that may need to be derived through analysis, such as:
         - Competitive positioning and benchmarking
         - Technology trend analysis
         - Performance/efficiency calculations
         - Market share and positioning analysis
         - Supply chain risk assessment
      
      4. Please list any industry knowledge, educated assessments, or strategic insights based on semiconductor domain expertise, including:
         - Technology maturity assessments
         - Competitive advantage analysis
         - Market trend predictions
         - Manufacturing feasibility evaluations

  When answering this survey, focus on semiconductor-specific "facts" such as technical specifications, performance metrics, manufacturing parameters, market data, and competitive intelligence. Use these headings:

      1. GIVEN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
      2. FACTS TO RESEARCH FROM INDUSTRY SOURCES  
      3. ANALYSIS TO DERIVE FROM DATA
      4. SEMICONDUCTOR DOMAIN EXPERTISE & INSIGHTS

  DO NOT include any other headings or sections in your response. DO NOT list next steps or plans until asked to do so.
