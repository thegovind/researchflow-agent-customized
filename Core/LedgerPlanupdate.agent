  This is the current semiconductor industry research plan we were executing for Qualcomm:

  Here are the updated semiconductor industry facts and manufacturing intelligence:

  Please briefly explain what went wrong with our semiconductor research approach (the root cause of the analysis failure), and then develop a new strategic plan that leverages manufacturing intelligence and competitive analysis to overcome prior challenges. Focus on semiconductor industry research methodologies and avoid repeating the same analytical mistakes.

  The new plan should be concise, expressed in bullet-point form, and optimized for semiconductor industry research. Consider the following specialized team composition for manufacturing intelligence and competitive analysis:
