# üß† Qualcomm ResearchFlow Agent

This specialized research agent is customized for Qualcomm's semiconductor manufacturing research needs. It orchestrates complex, multi-step research workflows to gather, synthesize, and structure knowledge from technical sources, market intelligence, and competitive analysis. Designed specifically for semiconductor industry analysts, product strategy teams, and technical research professionals.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Starter templates, instructions, code samples and resources in this msft-agent-samples file (‚Äúsamples‚Äù) are designed to assist in accelerating development of agents for specific scenarios. It is important that you review all provided resources and carefully test Agent behavior in the context of your use case: ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/agents/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext)). 

Certain Agent offerings may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may require licenses, or may not be suitable for all industries, scenarios, or use cases.‚ÄØBy using any sample, you are acknowledging that Agents or other output created using that sample are solely your responsibility, and that you will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and relevant safety standards, terms of service, and codes of conduct.

- ## üß© Tools & Capabilities

Built with **Azure AI Agent Service**, the ResearchFlow agent coordinates a graph of specialized agents to conduct structured research and synthesis tasks:

- **Planner Agent (`LedgerPlanner.agent`)** breaks down complex prompts into logical subtasks for targeted execution.
- **Summarizer Agent (`Summarizer.agent`)** condenses technical or lengthy content into clear summaries tailored to user intent.
- **File Search Tool** (used within the agent graph) allows agents to locate relevant content from uploaded documents, PDFs, or markdown.
- **Progress Manager Agent (`progressManager.agent`)** tracks task progression and orchestrates tool execution in multi-step workflows.
- **User Agent (`user.agent`)** and **Router logic** enable custom routing and user-specific personalization.
- **Fact Agents (`LedgerFacts.agent`, `LedgerFactsUpdate.agent`)** store and retrieve structured knowledge or annotations.
- **Plan Update Agent (`LedgerPlanUpdate.agent`)** refines or extends subtask chains as the plan evolves.

All tools and agents are declaratively configured in `.agent` and `.fdl` files.
