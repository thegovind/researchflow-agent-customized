  Analyze what challenges were encountered in the previous research execution and develop an improved approach that leverages lessons learned. Your expertise in semiconductor research methodologies will be crucial for overcoming technical research barriers.

  Provide a brief root cause analysis of the research challenges, then develop a refined research plan that:

  **Addresses Technical Barriers**: Identifies alternative approaches for gathering semiconductor specifications, competitive intelligence, or market data when primary sources are inaccessible.

  **Leverages Team Strengths**: Optimally utilizes your research team's specialized capabilities for maximum analytical effectiveness.

  **Incorporates Domain Knowledge**: Applies semiconductor industry expertise to guide research priorities and methodologies.

  **Avoids Repetitive Patterns**: Ensures the new approach doesn't repeat unsuccessful research strategies.

  **Maintains SemiAnalysis Standards**: Ensures the research depth and analytical rigor meet Qualcomm's expectations for strategic decision-making.

  Structure your response as:
  1. Brief explanation of the root cause challenges
  2. Refined bullet-point research plan with specific technical objectives
  3. Clear team member assignments based on specialized expertise

  Focus on actionable research steps that will advance the semiconductor analysis efficiently.
