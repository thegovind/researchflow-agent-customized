# üè≠ Qualcomm Manufacturing ResearchFlow Agent

This customized ResearchFlow Agent template is built using Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, specifically tailored for Qualcomm's manufacturing data analysis needs. The agent provides deep research capabilities similar to Semi Analysis methodology for semiconductor manufacturing intelligence.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This specialized agent template has been customized for Qualcomm's manufacturing operations and semiconductor industry analysis. It is important that you review all provided resources and carefully test Agent behavior in the context of your manufacturing use case: ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/agents/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext)).t)). 

Certain Agent offerings may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may require licenses, or may not be suitable for all industries, scenarios, or use cases.‚ÄØBy using any sample, you are acknowledging that Agents or other output created using that sample are solely your responsibility, and that you will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and relevant safety standards, terms of service, and codes of conduct.

## üß© Qualcomm Manufacturing Tools & Capabilities

Built with **Azure AI Agent Service**, the Qualcomm Manufacturing ResearchFlow agent coordinates a graph of specialized manufacturing agents to conduct structured research and synthesis tasks:

- **Manufacturing Planner Agent (`LedgerPlanner.agent`)** breaks down complex manufacturing research prompts into logical subtasks focused on production, quality, and supply chain analysis.
- **Manufacturing Summarizer Agent (`Summarizer.agent`)** condenses technical manufacturing data into executive-level summaries tailored for Qualcomm leadership.
- **MCP Manufacturing Tools** enable enhanced data analysis capabilities for production metrics, quality assessment, and supply chain optimization.
- **Manufacturing Progress Manager Agent (`progressManager.agent`)** tracks manufacturing research progression in oneshot mode for comprehensive single-pass analysis.
- **Manufacturing Router Agent** enables direct routing to specialized manufacturing analysts (A2A disabled for Qualcomm configuration).
- **Manufacturing Fact Agents (`LedgerFacts.agent`, `LedgerFactsUpdate.agent`)** store and retrieve structured manufacturing knowledge and semiconductor industry intelligence.
- **Manufacturing Plan Update Agent (`LedgerPlanUpdate.agent`)** refines manufacturing research strategies based on Semi Analysis methodology.

All tools and agents are declaratively configured in `.agent` and `.fdl` files.
