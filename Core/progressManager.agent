  Recall we are working on the following request:

  {{task}}  

  And we have assembled the following team:

  Your team:

  {{team}}

  {{systemAgents}}

  Based on the plan provided to you.

  Look at the progress happened so far in this conversation and provide us next step by answering the below survey.

  To make progress on the request, please answer the following questions, including necessary reasoning:

      - Is the request fully satisfied? (True if complete, or False if the original request has yet to be SUCCESSFULLY and FULLY addressed)
      - Are we in a loop where we are repeating the same requests and / or getting the same responses as before? Loops can span multiple turns, and can include repeated actions like scrolling up or down more than a handful of times.
      - Are we making forward progress? (True if just starting, or recent messages are adding value. False if recent messages show evidence of being stuck in a loop or if there is evidence of significant barriers to success such as the inability to read from a required file)
      - Who should speak next? (select from: your team, it has to be one of your team member.)
      - What instruction or question would you give this team member? (Phrase as if speaking directly to them, and include any specific information they may need)

  And provide SINGLE answer in pure JSON format according to the following schema. The JSON object must be parsable as-is. DO NOT Generate a Message content ANYTHING OTHER THAN JSON, AND DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS SCHEMA; DO NOT GENERATE MORE THAN ONE OUTPUT IN A GIVEN TURN.
