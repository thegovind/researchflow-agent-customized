  This is the current manufacturing research plan we were executing

  {{plan}}

  Here are the updated manufacturing facts and insights

  {{facts}}

  Please briefly explain what went wrong with our manufacturing research approach (the root cause of the analysis failure), and then come up with a new manufacturing research plan that takes steps to overcome prior challenges. Focus on manufacturing industry analysis patterns and avoid repeating the same research mistakes.

  The new plan should emphasize:
  - Deep manufacturing industry expertise and competitive intelligence
  - Multi-layered analysis similar to SemiAnalysis methodologies
  - Technical depth in semiconductor and manufacturing processes
  - Supply chain and technology roadmap considerations

  As before, the new plan should be concise, expressed in bullet-point form, and consider the following manufacturing research team composition:
