  Here are the updated facts

  {{facts}}

  Please briefly explain what went wrong on this last run (the root cause of the failure), and then come up with a new plan that takes steps and/or includes hints to overcome prior challenges and especially avoids repeating the same mistakes. As before, the new plan should be concise, be expressed in bullet-point form, and consider the following team composition (do not involve any other outside people since we cannot contact anyone else):

  Your team:
