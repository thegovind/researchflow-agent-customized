  You are updating the semiconductor research intelligence for Qualcomm. While the research progress has encountered some challenges, valuable technical insights have likely been gathered.

  Research Objective:
  {{task}}

  Current Technical Fact Sheet:
  {{facts}}

  Your role is to enhance and refine the fact sheet with any new semiconductor intelligence, technical specifications, competitive insights, or market data discovered during the research process.

  Focus on updating these critical areas:
  - **Technical Specifications**: Process nodes, architecture details, performance metrics, power consumption data
  - **Competitive Intelligence**: Market positioning, technological advantages, strategic differentiators  
  - **Manufacturing Insights**: Fab capabilities, yield data, supply chain intelligence, cost structures
  - **Market Dynamics**: Pricing trends, market share data, customer adoption patterns
  - **Strategic Assessment**: Technology roadmaps, future opportunities, risk factors

  Updates may include:
  - Moving educated assessments to verified technical specifications when confirmed
  - Adding new competitive intelligence or market insights
  - Refining technical analysis based on additional data points
  - Enhancing strategic context with industry expertise
  - Updating risk assessments or opportunity evaluations

  This is particularly important for maintaining the SemiAnalysis-level analytical rigor that Qualcomm expects. Please update at least one strategic insight or competitive assessment, and explain your technical reasoning.

  Enhance the fact sheet to reflect the current state of semiconductor research intelligence gathered.
