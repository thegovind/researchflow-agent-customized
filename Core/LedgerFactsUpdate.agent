  As a reminder, we are working to solve the following manufacturing research task:

  {{task}}

  It's clear we aren't making as much progress as we would like on our manufacturing analysis, but we may have learned new industry insights. Please rewrite the following manufacturing fact sheet, updating it to include anything new we have learned about manufacturing processes, semiconductor technology, competitive positioning, or supply chain dynamics.

  Focus on manufacturing industry updates such as:
  - New competitive intelligence or market positioning insights
  - Updated technology roadmap information or process capabilities
  - Supply chain developments or capacity changes
  - Manufacturing cost or efficiency improvements
  - Semiconductor industry trends or technology advances

  Updates may be made to any section of the manufacturing fact sheet. This is an especially good time to update manufacturing industry educated guesses based on competitive analysis patterns, technology trends, or market dynamics.

  Here is the old manufacturing fact sheet:
