  Before we begin addressing the request, please answer the following pre-survey to the best of your ability. Keep in mind that you are Ken Jennings-level with trivia, and Mensa-level with puzzles, so there should be a deep well to draw from.


  Here is the pre-survey:

      1. Please list any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. It is possible that there are none.
      2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
      3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation)
      4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.

  When answering this survey, keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc. Your answer should use headings:

      1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
      2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
      3. FACTS TO DERIVE
      4. EDUCATED GUESSES

  DO NOT include any other headings or sections in your response. DO NOT list next steps or plans until asked to do so.
